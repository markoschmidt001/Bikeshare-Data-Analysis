# Ford GoBike Data
## by Marko Schmidt


## Dataset

In this analysis I observed Data from the bikeshare company Ford GoBike to find patterns and answer interesting questions. For the analysis I used Januar to March 2019 from this source: ttps://s3.amazonaws.com/baywheels-data/index.html. To be able to carry out the analysis, I completed a few cleaning tasks in advance. These included creating new columns and converting data formats. I focused my analysis on the main features Duration, Starttime, Start- and Endtation and Usertype. To better understand the main features I used the following supporting features named, Day of the week, Hour of the day and Station information. I used the "Question-Visualization-Observations" framework throughout the exploration.

## Summary of Findings

To sum up I can say, that there are a lot of interessting findings to use for deeper analysis and further questions that may lead to business action:

- More trips are taken from subscribers then customers
- Customers are taking much longer trips then subscribers during all months
- Often most common start stations are also most common end stations
- Most of the trips do have a duration between 60 and 1000 seconds
- The day with the most trips is Thursday
- Less trips are taken on weekend
- There are peek hours around 7-9 am and 16-18 pm with more trips taken
- There are more longer and shorter journeys than for customers
- The spread of trip lengths is wider on weekdays than at weekends
- User who donÂ´t share bikes seems to take a bit longer trips
- The trip duration varies depending on the time


## Key Insights for Presentation

In my explanatory analysis i would like to focus on the trip distribution on days of the week and hour of the days. In addition I will have closer look at the ourly trip duration among user types.
